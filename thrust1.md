# Thrust 1: Machine Learning (ML) Workflows

## **Objective**
Discover new correlated and topological moir√© systems using advanced machine learning (ML) workflows.

## **Key Components**
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Aggregating datasets from simulations and experiments.
  - Feature engineering to capture relevant physical properties.
- **ML Models**:
  - Neural networks for property prediction.
  - Clustering algorithms to identify novel correlated systems.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Metrics for assessing model accuracy and relevance to physical phenomena.

## **Tools and Resources**
- Python libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn.
- Workflow automation with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/).

## **Example Workflow**
1. Data ingestion from high-throughput simulations.
2. Model training on physical property datasets.
3. Visualization of topological phases.
