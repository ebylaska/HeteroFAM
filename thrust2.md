# Thrust 2: Prototype Development

## **Objective**
Develop prototypes to study correlated electron physics and emergent states.

## **Prototypes**
1. **Model Systems**:
   - Lattice models for simulating electron correlations.
   - Simplified prototypes for emergent states (e.g., spin liquids).
2. **Hardware Integration**:
   - Experimental setups for real-world validation.

## **Research Questions**
- How do interactions in moir√© systems lead to emergent phenomena?
- What physical conditions optimize correlated states?

## **Example Prototype**
- Simulating Hubbard models to analyze electron behavior under external fields.
